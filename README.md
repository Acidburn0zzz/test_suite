# Custom tests

##Â Adding a new test

Just add your program in the `tests` folder. If the test is valid, it must
return `0`, otherwise, the test is considered as failed.

Be careful that the test must be able to run on the target, with a very simple
rootfs. Most of the common tools are unavailable.

Also, the only available shell is Busybox's Ash. Don't try to run some Bash or
you'll get some strange errors that are not always explicit.

Don't hesitate to read the other tests to see how they are implemented.

When run, the test will be passed the device-type it's running on as first
argument. Thus you can make some parts of the test board-specific if needed.  
**Be careful:** the device-type is the one used by LAVA, and therefore may not
correspond to the DT name, or any other name.
